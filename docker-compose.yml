# Guard Docker Compose - Environment Selector
#
# This file serves as a selector for different environments.
# Use the specific environment files for actual deployments:
#
# Development:  docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
# Production:   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
# Testing:      docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up
#
# For convenience, this file defaults to development environment.
